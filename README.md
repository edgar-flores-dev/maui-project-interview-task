Updating my xamarin forms app to maui
Coding Challenge:

Please create a Xamarin.Forms app with the features below. When complete, please push to an online repository we can access, such as GitHub or BitBucket (both allow private repos for free):

Use the MVVM design pattern. You may use any framework you like. [X]
The app should open to a tabbed page with 2 tabs. [X]
Each tab should have an icon from something like FontAwesome or MaterialDesignIcons. [ X ]
This should be pretty easy [ X ]
When the app launches for the first time, it should display a pop-up dialog welcoming the user. [ ]
This pop-up should never be displayed again. [ ]
First tab (LabelRotationView):
Provide an entry with its text bound to a property in the appropriate view-model. [ X ]
Provide a label that displays the text entered into the entry. [ X ]
Provide a slider bar. [ X ]
When the entry is empty, the slider should be disabled.[ X ]
When the slider’s thumb is dragged, the label should rotate all the way from 0 to 360 degrees. [ X ]
Second tab (UserDeviceInfoView): [ X ]
Provide a picker with 3 items: “Connectivity”, “Device Info”, and “Display Info”. [ X ]
Provide a button with either text, an icon, or an image.  [ X ]
When the button is tapped, the user should be navigated to a modal page which should display the information indicated by the picker  [ X ]
internet connectivity info  [ X ]
info about the user’s device  [ X ]
info about the user’s display - all of which can be found using Xamarin.Essentials.  [ X ]
Don’t worry too much about making the modal page look great… We just need to see the appropriate information.  [ X ]
Provide a “Dismiss” button on the modal page to navigate back.  
[ X ]
Bonus challenge: Add unit tests to the app. [ ]
Double-Bonus challenge: Add at least 1 UI test for the app. [ ]
